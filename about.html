        <h1>About</h1>

        <section style="margin: 2rem 0;">
            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>As a CTO and technical leader, I focus on building scalable systems, empowering engineering teams, and solving complex technical challenges. My work spans full-stack development, AI integration, and microservices architecture, with a particular interest in how technology can enhance education and everyday experiences.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I've learned that the best technical solutions come from understanding both the code and the people who write it. This perspective shapes my approach to leadership—balancing technical excellence with developer growth and well-being.</p>

            <h2>Technical Leadership Philosophy</h2>

            <h3>Developer Growth & Learning</h3>
            <p>I believe deeply in the principles I wrote about in <a href="https://substack.com/@motleycoder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"AI Tools and Developer Growth"</a>—that efficiency gains should translate to deeper learning, not just faster shipping. The best teams are those where developers are continuously growing their skills and understanding.</p>

            <h3>Code Quality & Pragmatism</h3>
            <p>Perfect is the enemy of good, but good is the enemy of shipping. I advocate for finding the right balance: clean, maintainable code that solves real problems without over-engineering. Technical debt is fine if it's intentional and documented.</p>

            <h3>System Design Thinking</h3>
            <p>Good architecture isn't about using the latest technologies—it's about understanding trade-offs. Microservices aren't always better than monoliths. Distributed systems introduce complexity that must be justified. Every architectural decision should be made with clear reasoning and documented for future maintainers.</p>

            <h3>Team Enablement</h3>
            <p>The role of a CTO isn't just to write code or make technical decisions—it's to create an environment where the entire team can do their best work. This means clear communication, good documentation, thoughtful code reviews, and building systems that are a joy to work with.</p>

            <h2>Areas of Expertise</h2>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Full-Stack Development</h3>
                <p><strong>Frontend:</strong> Next.js, React, TypeScript, Flutter/Dart, modern CSS patterns<br>
                <strong>Backend:</strong> FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, RESTful APIs, microservices<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> End-to-end ownership allows me to make better architectural decisions and understand the full impact of technical choices.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>AI/ML Integration</h3>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Google Gemini, RAG patterns, content generation, AI-powered workflows<br>
                <strong>Focus:</strong> Practical AI applications that solve real problems, not AI for AI's sake<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI is transforming how we build software. Understanding how to integrate it effectively—and when not to—is crucial for modern CTOs.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Microservices & API Architecture</h3>
                <p><strong>Patterns:</strong> API design, middleware layers, service orchestration, event-driven architecture<br>
                <strong>Experience:</strong> Building production middleware with authentication, connection pooling, and error handling<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Scalable systems require thoughtful decomposition and clear service boundaries.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Database Design & Security</h3>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> PostgreSQL, Supabase, SQLAlchemy ORM<br>
                <strong>Specialization:</strong> Row Level Security (RLS), authorization patterns, data modeling<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Data is often an application's most valuable asset. Proper security and design are non-negotiable.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Authentication & Security</h3>
                <p><strong>Implementations:</strong> JWT, OAuth 2.0, dual-layer authentication, CSP headers<br>
                <strong>Approach:</strong> Defense in depth, principle of least privilege, security by design<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Security can't be bolted on—it must be built in from the start.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
                <p><strong>Techniques:</strong> Connection pooling, async/await patterns, caching strategies, lazy loading<br>
                <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Measure before optimizing. Premature optimization is a trap, but ignoring performance is negligent.<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Users judge applications by responsiveness. Performance is a feature.</p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>DevOps & Infrastructure</h3>
                <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Docker, Nginx, Raspberry Pi hosting, Let's Encrypt SSL<br>
                <strong>Approach:</strong> Infrastructure as code, automated deployments, monitoring<br>
                <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Understanding the full stack from code to infrastructure enables better architectural decisions and faster debugging.</p>

            <h2>Current Focus</h2>
            <p>I'm particularly interested in the intersection of AI and education—how we can use technology to create personalized learning experiences at scale. My recent work with EduVideoAI reflects this focus, exploring how AI can transform existing content into targeted educational materials.</p>

            <p>I'm also exploring the evolving role of CTOs in AI-first companies, where the challenge isn't just building software, but building systems that learn and adapt. This requires new patterns for testing, monitoring, and managing AI-powered features.</p>

            <p>On the writing front, I'm working on a series about technical leadership—sharing lessons learned about architecture decisions, team building, and the balance between velocity and sustainability.</p>
